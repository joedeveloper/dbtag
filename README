dbtag
=====

This is a small utility to tag databases and settings for Ruby on Rails projects.
This is useful if:
* you have ~ monthly releases that have database migrations (this utility supports only mysql at the moment)
* feature branches with migrations
The idea is to create a database and settings backup on devbox in one command when you create git/svn branch, then checkout this database and settings if you need to work on branch code.

What is a Tag
=============

A backup of development (with data) and test (structure) databases.
A backup of old settings files that might change (a settings file is any file that has an example in myapp/config/*.example)

Install
=======

I intend to make this into a gem. Currenly, just drop this rake file into yourapp/lib/tasks

Example Workflow
================

# just released prod version 123
rake dbtag:tag = t=prod123 # create a new tag
rake dbtag:br # see all tags
# do work on master, create migrations, run them etc
# update settings files, add new values, change old ones
# bug in prod found, git/svn co prod123 to have failing code. Can not work with master database as new migrations break application.
rake dbtag:co t=prod123 # checkout a prod123 tag
# do work, commit
rake dbtag:co # checkout master
# work on master again
# release is comming, branch in git/svn is created
rake dbtag:tag t=prod124
# released
rake dbtag:untag t=prod123
